  # Variables
  # =========
  #
  # The following values should be registered as variables and this file 
  # generated.
  # 
  # server name: main domain name
  # server alias: alternate domain names separated by space
  # system username: owner of the project files
  # project name
  # project root: absolute base directory for the project, contains
  #               www, logs, tmp, apache.conf... and other project-related 
  #               files. Should contain "system username" and "project name".
  # directories: temporary, sessions, logs, ...

  # Drupal specific
  # ===============
  # 
  # The following directories are referenced as Drupal variables (in DB):
  # * file_directory_temp: defaults to /tmp in standard Drupal installation
  # * file_directory_path: defaults to sites/SITENAME/files (relative)

  # Tests
  # =====
  # 
  # Here is some notes about testing this configuration file. Assert that...:
  # 
  # * referenced directories or files exist.
  # * referenced directories are readable by the Apache user.
  # * some directories are writable by the Apache user (like www-data). It 
  #   includes the temporary directory, maybe the logs directory, the 
  #   PHP-session directory.
  # * memory_limit is lower than server's available memory
  # * upload_max_filesize is lower than server's available memory
  # * upload_max_filesize is lower than or equals memory_limit

    # This configuration part is meant to be generic and may be compatible with
